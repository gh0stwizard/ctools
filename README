List of small, useful (IMHO) programs while I'm learning C language:

* days.c        - counts days between two dates
* htoi.c        - converts hex number into decimal integer
* numconv.c     - converts decimal number into another with base between 2
                  and 16
* pow.c         - raises a number to the choosen power
* revnum.c      - prints a number in reverse
* loadavg.c     - prints system load average
* sod.c         - prints shared object dependencies


Part of code sources has been taken from famous sources, like K&R with and 
without changes. So, yep, there is nothing new :-P
