List of small useful, IMO, programs while I'm learning C language:

* days.c	- counts days between two dates
* htoi.c	- converts hex number into decimal integer
* numconv.c	- converts decimal number into another with base between 2
and 16
* pow.c		- raises a number to the choosen power
* revnum.c 	- prints a number in reverse
